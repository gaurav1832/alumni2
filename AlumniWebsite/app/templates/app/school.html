<h3>Our Expanding Horizons</h3>
<p class="font-large">
    Our thoughts and capabilities keep growing, and so does the school. Every day of every year, we
    strive to make better education available to more and more people, and today we have a great big
    school as a reward for all our efforts. <br />
    St. Thomas today comprises of about 3800 students and 150 teachers along with 35 staff members,
    currently in the school, not to mention the thousands of alumni and ex-faculty still a very integral
    part of the community. The school has grown much in size and infrastructure, and presents better
    facilities to its students and teachers for easier and more effective education, including digital
    learning, well furnished hands on labs and extensive libraries.<br/>
    In our pursuit to make education available to all, we have expanded out to a branch, St. Thomas
    Hardag, a community funded school for the poor. We hope that the extension will soon pick up pace
    and be able to provide high quality education to those who had far too much brains but not the 
    resources to get it. <br />
